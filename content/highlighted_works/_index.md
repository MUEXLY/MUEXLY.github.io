          <p style="margin-bottom">Dislocations and their mobility control plasticity in metals. In tungsten, we found that as temperature rises, dislocations shift from non-Arrhenius to Arrhenius behavior when overcoming elastic barriers due to the role of activation entropy.</p>

          <p style="margin-bottom"> Dislocation mobility is traditionally derived from complex simulations. We propose a new approach using Physics-informed Graph Neural Networks to learn mobility laws from molecular dynamics, improving upon existing models by incorporating uncertainty quantification and active learning.</p>

          <p style="margin-bottom">We present a model for impurity concentration in solid solutions and apply it to vacancies and small interstitials. We then calculate the vacancy concentration as a function of temperature in CoNiCrFeMn and FeAl for various chemical orderings with atomistic simulations, which showed no clear correlation between vacancy thermodynamics and chemical ordering in CoNiCrFeMn but clear patterns for FeAl.</p>

          <p style="margin-bottom">Short-range order (SRO) in multicomponent concentrated alloys affects their mechanical response. We present here a methodology to predict the SRO and thermodynamic properties in chemically complex systems and apply it to WTaCrVHf. We observe that the addition of Hf significantly modifies the SRO, matching experimental observations.</p>
