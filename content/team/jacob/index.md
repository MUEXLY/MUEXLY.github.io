Hello! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Jacob and I am currently a Ph.D. student in Materials Science and Engineering. I am also the Vice President of the [CECAS Graduate Student Advisory Board](https://www.clemson.edu/cecas/students/community/gsab.html).

I joined the group in 2022 as an undergraduate performing molecular dynamics simulations of vacancy hopping in tungsten subject to a strong thermal gradient.

ðŸŒ± I am currently working on:

- Transport and grain boundary segregation in High Entropy Alloys 
- Multi-scale modeling of radiation-induced segregation
- Diffusion on rough potential energy surfaces
- Non-equilibrium vacancy transport in tungsten
- Kinetic Monte Carlo simulations of organic nanocrystalline growth

You can see more of my projects on my [GitHub](https://github.com/jwjeffr) profile, as well as a more-detailed description of my experience in my [CV](cv/main.pdf).
