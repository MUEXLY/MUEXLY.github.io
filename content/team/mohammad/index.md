My name is Mohammad and I am currently a Ph.D. student in Mechanical Engineering. I have earned my B.S and M.S degrees in Mecahnical Engineeing from Iran University of Science & Technology and University of Tehran doing research in soft matters and complex fluids. I started my PhD in Spring 2022 as focusing on molecular dynamics simulations and theoretical studies to investigate role of entropy in rate of reaction for tungsten. We published this work in Computational Materials Science and the link is provided [here](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.commatsci.2024.112954). I have presented my research at [MS&T2023](https://www.tms.org/TMS2023/TMS2023/Default.aspx) and [TMS2024](https://www.tms.org/TMS2024/TMS2024/Default.aspx) as a talk and also presented a poster in MADE in SC Research Fellows & All faculty Conference in 2022.


I am currently doing research on:

- Radiation Induced Segregation of structural composition-aware alloys. 
- Kinetic Monte Carlo simulations for Radiation Induced Segregation.
- Prediction of rate of reaction in grain boundary migration (MD & theoretical Studies).
- Dislocation dipole separation rate (MD & theoretical Studies).

Awards:
- Graduate Travel Grant from Graduate student government of Clemson University for [MS&T2023](https://www.tms.org/TMS2023/TMS2023/Default.aspx).
- CECAS GSAB Supplementary Travel Award for [TMS2024](https://www.tms.org/TMS2024/TMS2024/Default.aspx).
- Mechanical Engineering Department of Clemson University Excellence Award for Graduate Teaching Assistants 2024.
