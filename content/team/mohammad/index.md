I am currently a Ph.D. student in Mechanical Engineering. I have earned my B.S and M.S degrees in Mecahnical Engineeing from **Iran University of Science & Technology** and **University of Tehran** doing research in soft matters and complex fluids. I started my PhD in Spring 2022 as focusing on Molecular Dynamics Simulations and theoretical studies to investigate role of entropy in rate of reaction for tungsten. We published this work in **Computational Materials Science** and the link is provided [here](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.commatsci.2024.112954). I have presented my research at [MS&T2023](https://www.tms.org/TMS2023/TMS2023/Default.aspx) and [TMS2024](https://www.tms.org/TMS2024/TMS2024/Default.aspx) as a talk and also presented a poster in MADE in SC Research Fellows & All faculty Conference in 2022.
