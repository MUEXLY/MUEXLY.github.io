I am currently a Ph.D. Candiadate and Graduate Research Assistant in Mechanical Engineering. I have earned my B.S and M.S degrees in Mecahnical Engineeing from **Iran University of Science & Technology** and **University of Tehran** doing research in soft matters and complex fluids. I started my PhD joining Dr. Martinez's group in Spring 2022 focusing on Molecular Dynamics Simulations and theoretical studies. In my first project, I investigated role of entropy in rate of reaction for defected tungsten throught three different methods collaborating with research scientists from LANL. We published this work in [**Computational Materials Science**](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.commatsci.2024.112954). I have presented my research at [MS&T2023](https://www.tms.org/TMS2023/TMS2023/Default.aspx), [TMS2024](https://www.tms.org/TMS2024/TMS2024/Default.aspx), and [MRS2024](https://www.mrs.org/meetings-events/annual-meetings/archive/meeting/presentations/view/2024-fall-meeting/2024-fall-meeting-4136437) as a talk and also presented a poster in MADE in SC Research Fellows & All faculty Conference in 2022.
