My name is Mohammad and I am currently a Ph.D. student in Mechanical Engineering. 
I started my PhD in Spring 2022 as focusing on molecular dynamics simulations and theoretical studies to investigate role of entropy in rate of reaction for tungsten. We published this work in Computational Materials Science and the link is provided [here](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.commatsci.2024.112954). I have presented my research at [MS&T2023](https://www.tms.org/TMS2023/TMS2023/Default.aspx) and [TMS2024](https://www.tms.org/TMS2024/TMS2024/Default.aspx) as a talk and also presented a poster in MADE in SC Research Fellows & All faculty Conference in 2022.


I am currently doing research on:

- Radiation Induced Segregation of structural composition-aware alloys. 
- Kinetic Monte Carlo simulations for Radiation Induced Segregation.
- Prediction of rate of reaction in grain boundary migration (MD & theoretical Studies).
- Dislocation dipole separation rate (MD & theoretical Studies).
