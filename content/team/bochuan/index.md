Bochuan is a Ph.D. student in the Materials Science and Engineering department at Clemson university, whose research focus is on fusion irradiation of refreactory metals. For more information on refractory metal (W) [crystallography](crystallography of W_EMS.pptx), or [fusion irradiation damage](fusion irradiation damage in W_EMS.pptx), follow either respective link. 

Bochuan's [current research proposal](2023_spring_MSE_proposal_Bochuan_Sun_3rd_edition.docx) contains information regarding [computational methodologies for materials research](3 computational methodologies in this dissertation_EMS.pptx) along with an [oral presentation](Oral_presentation_Bochuan.pptx) pertaining to his current works.
