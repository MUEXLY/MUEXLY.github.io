Liam met Professor Enrique and joined his lab as an undergraduate researcher in the Spring semester of 2021. His first project involved the analysis of point defect interactions near a mobile grain boundary using a Kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) algorithm. The cumulative results of the project were compiled and presented at the 2021 Summer Undergraduate Research Symposium hosted at Clemson University.

Liam continued to work with Professor Enrique throughout a 2 year Masters program, in affiliation with Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL), helping to develop a closed-loop Molecular Dynamics (MD) to Discrete Dislocation Dynamics (DDD) system whereby a trained Graph Neural Network (GNN) can extract dynamics information from a database of MD configurations to learn an applied mobility law for DDD simulations. In addition, Liam has studied the thermally activated regime of dislocation dynamics through Stochastic Dislocation Dynamics (SDD) simulations whereby the energy barrier to drive dislocations over local minima was tailored to be a temperature and rate dependent process. The full extent of his findings are presented in his M.S. thesis, which can be found in the Highlighted Works tab.

Liam is continuing his academic career as a Ph.D. student studying more complex cases of thermally activated dislocation behavior, including stacking fault tetrahedra annihilation, prismatic loop rafting, and dislocation junction zipping and unzipping behaviors.
