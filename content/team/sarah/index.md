My name is Sarah Paguaga and I am a Senior Mechanical Engineering Student with a MSE and a Mathematics minor. I am currently working on my Departmental Honors thesis in affiliation with my work at Los Alamos National Labs! I am currently using atomistic simulations to study the effect of irradiation around grain boundaries in single element and multi-alloy systems! [Attached](TMS2024_Poster_Paguaga.pdf) is a poster I presented at TMS 2024 that summarizes my current work!
