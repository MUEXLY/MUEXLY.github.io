**Segregation, ordering, and precipitation in refractory alloys**

Jesper Byggmästar, Damian Sobieraj, Jan Wróbel, Daniel K. Schreiber, Osman El-Atwani, <b>Enrique Martínez</b>, D. Nguyen-Manh

December 2024

<sub><sup>
Tungsten-based low-activation high-entropy alloys are possible candidates for next-generation fusion reactors due to their exceptional tolerance to irradiation, thermal loads, and stress. We develop an accurate and efficient machine-learned interatomic potential for the W-Ta-Cr-V system and use it in hybrid Monte Carlo molecular dynamics simulations of ordering and segregation to all common types of defects in WTaCrV. The predictions are compared to atom probe tomography analysis of segregation and precipitation in WTaCrV thin films. By also considering two other alloys, WTaV and MoNbTaVW, we are able to draw general conclusions about preferred segregation in refractory alloys and the reasons behind it, guiding future alloy design and elucidating experimental observations. We show that the experimentally observed CrV precipitates in WTaCrV form semicoherent bcc-to-bcc interfaces with the surrounding matrix, as coherent precipitates are not thermodynamically stable due to excessive lattice mismatch. The predictions from simulations align well with our atom probe tomography analysis as well as previous experimental observations.

**Design Kinetic Parameters for Improved Resilience of Materials under
  Irradiation**

<b>Mohammadhossein Nahavandian</b>, Eda Aydogan, Jesper Byggmästar, Matheus A. Tunes, <b>Enrique Martínez</b>, Osman El-Atwani

December 2024

<sub><sup>
High entropy alloys (HEAs) have captured much attention in recent years due to their conceivably improved radiation resistance compared to pure metals and traditional alloys. However, among HEAs, there are millions of design possibilities considering all potential compositions. In this study, we develop criteria to design HEAs with improved radiation resilience taking into consideration defect properties to promote interstitial-vacancy recombination. First, we conduct rate theory calculations on defects followed by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations on pure W and W-based multicomponent concentrated alloys. It is found that when the diffusion coefficients for single vacancies and interstitials become similar and the effective migration energies of defects is minimum (maximum diffusivities), defect recombination becomes optimal, and the concentration of defects is significantly reduced. This is supported by MD simulations indicating improved radiation resistance of V- and Cr-based alloys, which satisfy the above-stated criteria. Furthermore, experimental observations also reinforce the proposed approach. This study sheds light on the design criteria for improved radiation resistance and helps material selection without the need of extensive experimental work.

**Enhancing Irradiation Resistance in Refractory Medium Entropy Alloys
  with Simplified Chemistry**

<sub><sup>
Refractory High-Entropy Alloys (RHEAs) hold promising potential to be used as structural materials in future nuclear fusion reactors, where W and its alloys are currently leading candidates. Fusion materials must be able to withstand extreme conditions, such as (i) severe radiation-damage arising from highly-energetic neutrons, (ii) embrittlement caused by implantation of H and He ions, and (iii) exposure to extreme high-temperatures and thermal gradients. Recent research demonstrated that two RHEAs - the WTaCrV and WTaCrVHf - can outperform both coarse-grained and nanocrystalline W in terms of its radiation response and microstructural stability. Chemical complexity and nanocrystallinity enhance the radiation tolerance of these new RHEAs, but their multi-element nature, including low-melting Cr, complicates bulk fabrication and limits practical applications. We demonstrate that reducing the number of alloying elements and yet retain high-radiation tolerance is possible within the ternary system W-Ta-V via synthesis of two novel nanocrystalline refractory medium-entropy alloys (RMEAs): the W$_{53}$Ta$_{44}$V$_{3}$ and W$_{53}$Ta$_{42}$V$_{5}$ (in at.\%). We experimentally show that the radiation response of the W-Ta-V system can be tailored by small additions of V, and such experimental result was validated with theoretical analysis of chemical short-range orders (CSRO) from combined ab-initio atomistic Monte-Carlo modeling. It is predicted from computational analysis that a small change in V concentration has a significant effect on the Ta-V CRSO between W$_{53}$Ta$_{44}$V$_{3}$ and W$_{53}$Ta$_{42}$V$_{5}$ leading to radiation-resistant microstructures in these RMEAs from chemistry stand-point of views. We deviate from the original high-entropy alloy concept to show that high radiation resistance can be achieved in systems with simplified chemical complexity.

**Influence of the distance of a collisional cascade to an edge dipole in <mml:math xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" altimg="si2.svg" display="inline" id="d1e435"><mml:mi>α</mml:mi></mml:math>-Fe on dislocation mobility and defect production**

April 2024

<sub><sup>
In this work we studied the effects of 20 keV collision cascades in alpha iron with a 1/2〈111〉{110} edge dipole using molecular dynamics. We analysed three different cases: a) the primary knock-on atom (PKA) is centered between both dislocations, b) the PKA is closer to one of the dislocations, and c) the PKA is on top of one of the dislocations and directed towards it. Our calculations show enhanced formation of vacancy clusters in the bulk for intermediate distances due to the absorption of self-interstitials by the dislocation during the collision cascade reducing the recombination between vacancies and self-interstitials. This effect results in the formation of jogs at the dislocation and the consequent climb due to the absorption of the self-interstitials. As a result, there is an unbalance between vacancies and self-interstitials produced by the collision cascade, with a significantly larger number of vacancies than self-interstitials in the bulk and the formation of large vacancy clusters. When the collision cascade develops directly on top of the dislocation, jogs are formed due to both the absorption of vacancies and self-interstitials, inducing climb and with the total dislocation length increasing up to several nanometers.

**Grain boundary metastability controls irradiation resistance in
  nanocrystalline metals**

<sub><sup>
Grain boundaries (GBs) in polycrystalline materials are powerful sinks for irradiation defects. While standard theories assume that the sink efficiency of a grain boundary is defined solely by its character before irradiation, recent evidence conclusively shows that the irradiation sink efficiency is a highly dynamic property controlled by the intrinsic metastability of GBs under far-from-equilibrium irradiation conditions. In this paper, we reveal that the denuded (i.e., defect-free) zone, typically the signature of a strong sink, can collapse as irradiation damage accumulates. We propose a radiation damage evolution model that captures this behavior based on the emergence of a series of irradiation defect-enabled metastable GB microstate changes that dynamically alter the ability of the GB to absorb further damage. We show that these microstate changes control further defect absorption and give rise to the formation of a defect network that manifests itself as a net Nye-tensor signal detectable via lattice curvature experiments.

**Data-Driven Modeling of Dislocation Mobility from Atomistics using Physics-Informed Machine Learning**

Yifeng Tian, Soumendu Bagchi, <b>Liam Myhill</b>, Giacomo Po, <b>Enrique Martínez</b>, Yen Ting Lin, Nithin Mathew, Danny Pérez

April 2024

<sub><sup>
<title>Abstract</title> Dislocation mobility, which dictates the response of dislocations to an applied stress, is a fundamental property of crystalline materials that governs the evolution of plastic deformation. Traditional approaches for deriving mobility laws rely on phenomenological models of the underlying physics, whose free parameters are in turn fitted to a small number of intuition-driven atomic scale simulations under varying conditions of temperature and stress. This tedious and time-consuming approach becomes particularly cumbersome for materials with complex dependencies on stress, temperature, and local environment, such as body-centered cubic crystals (BCC) metals and alloys. In this paper, we present a novel, uncertainty quantification-driven active learning paradigm for learning dislocation mobility laws from automated high-throughput large-scale molecular dynamics simulations, using Graph Neural Networks (GNN) with a physics-informed architecture. We demonstrate that this Physics-informed Graph Neural Network (PI-GNN) framework captures the underlying physics more accurately compared to existing phenomenological mobility laws in BCC metals.

**Primary Defect Production in Doped Iron Grain Boundaries during Low
  Energy Collision Cascades**

Yang Zhang, Blas P. Uberuaga, <b>Enrique Martínez</b>, Jason R. Trelewicz

March 2024

<sub><sup>
This study explores the intricate interactions between grain boundaries (GBs) and irradiation-induced defects in nanocrystalline iron, highlighting the role of dopants like copper. Utilizing molecular dynamics simulations, the research delineates how GB properties, such as GB energy and defect formation energies, influence the formation and evolution of defects in low energy collision cascades. It reveals that GBs not only augment defect production but also show a marked preference for interstitials over vacancies, a behavior significantly modulated by the cascade's proximity to the GB. The presence of dopants is shown to alter GB properties, affecting both the rate and type of defect production, thereby underscoring the complex interplay between GB characteristics, dopant elements, and defect dynamics. Moreover, the investigation uncovers that the structural characteristics of GBs play a crucial role in cascade evolution and defect generation, with certain GB configurations undergoing reconfiguration in response to cascades. For instance, the reconfiguration of one pure Fe twist GB suggests that GB geometry can significantly influence defect generation mechanisms. These findings point to the potential of GB engineering in developing materials with enhanced radiation tolerance, advocating for a nuanced approach to material design. By tailoring GB properties and selectively introducing dopant elements, materials can be optimized to exhibit superior resistance to radiation-induced damage, offering insights for applications in nuclear reactors and other radiation-prone environments.

**Stochastic Integration of the Cahn-Hilliard Phase Field Equations**

Qianran Yu, Nick Julian, Jaime Marian, <b>Enrique Martínez</b>

February 2024

<sub><sup>
In this work we develop a stochastic algorithm to integrate the Cahn-Hilliard equations. The algorithm is based on Gillespie's stochastic simulation algorithm, also known as kinetic Monte Carlo. The deterministic integration of the phase field equations leads to the closest minimum of free energy and does not overcome free energy barriers. However, in the nucleation and growth regime of the phase diagram, free energy barriers need to be thermally overcome for the system to phase separate to reach equilibrium. We show in this work that the proposed stochastic integration algorithm indeed allows the system to overcome free energy barriers. We discuss the results in terms of fluctuation distributions, grid sizes and efficiency.

**Langmuir-like model of dilute impurities in concentrated solid solutions**

<b>Jacob Jeffries</b>, <b>Enrique Martínez</b>

February 2024

<sub><sup>
High-entropy alloys have drawn recent interest for their promising mechanical properties and irradiation resistance. Various properties, namely transport properties, are controlled by point defect concentration, which must be known before performing atomistic simulations to compute transport coefficients. In this work, we present a general Langmuir-like model for impurity concentration in an arbitrarily complex solid solution and apply this model to generate expressions for concentrations of vacancies and small interstitial atoms. We then calculate the vacancy concentration as a function of temperature in the equiatomic CoNiCrFeMn and FeAl alloys with modified embedded-atom-method potentials for various chemical orderings, showing there is no clear correlation between vacancy thermodynamics and chemical ordering in the CoNiCrFeMn alloy but clear systematic patterns for FeAl.

**From anti-Arrhenius to Arrhenius behavior in a dislocation-obstacle bypass: Atomistic Simulations and Theoretical Investigation**

<b>Mohammadhossein Nahavandian</b>, Soumit Sarkar, Soumendu Bagchi, Danny Pérez, <b>Enrique Martínez</b>

January 2024

<sub><sup>
Dislocations are the primary carriers of plasticity in metallic material. Understanding the basic mechanisms for dislocation movement is paramount to predicting the material mechanical response. Relying on atomistic simulations, we observe a transition from non-Arrhenius to Arrhenius behavior in the rate for an edge dislocation to overcome the elastic interaction with a prismatic loop in tungsten. Beyond the critical resolved shear stress, the process shows a non-Arrhenius behavior at low temperatures. However, as the temperature increases, the activation entropy starts to dominate, leading to a traditional Arrhenius behavior. We have computed the activation entropy analytically along the minimum energy path following Schoeck's methods [1], which capture the cross-over between anti-Arrhenius and Arrhenius domains. Also, the Projected Average Force Integrator (PAFI) [2], another simulation method to compute free energies along an initial transition path, exhibits considerable concurrence with Schoeck's formalism. We conclude that entropic effects need to be considered to understand processes involving dislocations bypassing elastic barriers close to the critical resolved shear stress. More work needs to be performed to fully understand the discrepancies between Schoeck's and PAFI results compared to molecular dynamics.

**Shock wave induced migration of an edge dislocation dipole in alpha-Fe**

Santiago Heredia‐Avalos, Cristian D. Denton, Juan Carlos Moreno-Marı́n, <b>Enrique Martínez</b>, M.J. Caturla

December 2023

<sub><sup>
The mobility of a 1/2〈111〉{110} edge dipole in alpha-iron has been studied using molecular dynamics simulations. Collision cascades generated by keV recoils have been shown to induce the migration of dislocations. In order to elucidate the origin of the motion of these dislocations, and separate the production of defects from temperature or pressure effects, a stressed region of different shapes (sphere and cylinder) is simulated close to the edge dipole. We observe that the generated shock wave triggers the movement of the dislocations even when no defects are produced. The shape of the distorted region and the character of the dislocations influence the way the dislocations move, due to the change in Peach-Koehler force direction and to the fact that the shock waves arrive to the different parts of the dislocations at different times.

<sub><sup>
This study aims to compare the effects of neutron and self-ion irradiation on the mechanical properties and microstructural evolution in W. Neutron irradiation at the HFR reactor to 1.67 dpa at 800 °C resulted in the formation of large Re and Os rich clusters and voids. The post-irradiation composition was measured using APT and verfified against FISPACT modelling. The measured Re and Os concentration was used to create alloys with equivalent concentrations of Re and Os. These alloys were exposed to self-ion irradiation to a peak dose of 1.7 dpa at 800 °C. APT showed that self-ion irradiation leads to the formation of small Os clusters, wheras under neutron irradiation large Re/Os clusters form. Voids are formed by both ion and neutron irradiation, but the voids formed by neutron irradiation are larger. By comparing the behaviour of W-1.4Re and W-1.4Re-0.1Os, suppression of Re cluster formation was observed. Irradiation hardening was measured using nanoindentation and was found to be 2.7 GPa, after neutron irradiation and 1.6 GPa and 0.6 GPa for the self-ion irradiated W-1.4Re and W-1.4Re-0.1Os. The higher hardening is attributed to the barrier strength of large voids and Re/Os clusters that are observed after neutron irradiation.

**A novel route to fibers with volatile crystalline semiconductor cores part 2: Selenides and phosphides**

Thomasina Zaengle, <b>Enrique Martínez</b>, Thomas W. Hawkins, Colin D. McMillen, John Ballato

October 2023

<sub><sup>
The flux assisted molten core method, previously employed to fabricate glass-clad crystalline GaAs core fiber, is applied here to realize crystalline selenide and phosphide cores. These semiconductor families show great promise in photonics, optoelectronics, and thermoelectrics, although their volatility has previously prohibited successful fabrication utilizing the conventional molten core method. Through the introduction of a flux, the alloy melt temperature and associated vapor pressure can be sufficiently reduced to permit thermal drawing of the melt inside a glass cladding into fiber. Reported here are demonstrations of crystalline selenide and phosphide cores. Also reported is the CO2 laser post processing of a ZnSe core fluxed with Cu8GeSe6, which resulted in lateral segregation of the ZnSe phase from the flux. X-ray diffraction and electron microscopy were deployed to determine the resulting ZnSe, InP and flux alloy phases and elemental distributions in the fiber core. X-ray diffraction of the InP: flux and most of the ZnSe: flux systems showed intermetallic flux phases that were not present on the phase diagrams reported in the literature. Formation enthalpy and phase diagrams of the intermetallic phases at room temperature were used to determine which observed phases were thermodynamically stable or meta-stable. The results indicate that the influences at play are primarily thermodynamic, but in some cases, kinetics plays a role during the fabrication of these fibers, forming metastable phases. Lastly, a review and discussion of the new demands on cladding glasses is presented for laser post-processing such fibers. This work demonstrates an approach to incorporating volatile and incongruently melting phases, that are not compatible with the standard molten core method, to realize novel in-fiber optoelectronic compositions.

**Impact of Soret effect on hydrogen and helium retention in PFC tungsten under ELM-like conditions**

Dwaipayan Dasgupta, Sophie Blondel, <b>Enrique Martínez</b>, Dimitrios Maroudas, Brian D. Wirth

May 2023

<sub><sup>
Abstract In our previous work, we have demonstrated using nonequilibrium molecular-dynamics simulations that the fluxes of helium and self-interstitial atoms in the presence of a thermal gradient in tungsten are directed opposite to the heat flux, indicating that species transport is governed by a Soret effect, namely, thermal-gradient-driven diffusion, characterized by a negative heat of transport that drives species transport uphill, i.e. from the cooler to the hot regions of the tungsten sample. In this work, the findings of our thermal and species transport analysis have been implemented in our cluster-dynamics code, Xolotl, which has been used to compute temperature and species profiles over spatiotemporal scales representative of plasma-facing component (PFC) tungsten under typical reactor operating conditions, including extreme heat loads at the plasma-facing surface characteristic of plasma instabilities that induce edge localized modes (ELMs). We demonstrate that the steady-state species profiles, when properly accounting for the Soret effect, vary significantly from those where temperature-gradient-driven transport is not accounted for and discuss the implications of such a Soret effect on the response to plasma exposure of plasma-facing tungsten. Although our cluster-dynamics simulations do not yet include self-clustering of helium or hydrogen blister formation, our simulation results show that the Soret effect substantially reduces helium and hydrogenic species retention inside PFC tungsten.

<sub><sup>
In nanocrystalline high entropy alloys (HEAs), the difference in chemistry and the density of interfaces play a role in the microstructure evolution, although their relative importance is not well understood. Here, we compare data published in the literature regarding dislocation loop damage in pure W under ion irradiation to new results on nanocrystalline and coarse grained HEAs irradiated under single and dual ion beams. Dislocation loop damage evolution has been studied. The results suggest that both grain boundaries and grain matrices play important roles in the microstructure evolution of HEAs with grain matrices playing the dominant role.

<sub><sup>
In the quest of new materials that can withstand severe irradiation and mechanical extremes for advanced applications (e.g. fission & fusion reactors, space applications, etc.), design, prediction and control of advanced materials beyond current material designs become paramount. Here, through a combined experimental and simulation methodology, we design a nanocrystalline refractory high entropy alloy (RHEA) system. Compositions assessed under extreme environments and in situ electron-microscopy reveal both high thermal stability and radiation resistance. We observe grain refinement under heavy ion irradiation and resistance to dual-beam irradiation and helium implantation in the form of low defect generation and evolution, as well as no detectable grain growth. The experimental and modeling results-showing a good agreement-can be applied to design and rapidly assess other alloys subjected to extreme environmental conditions.

<sub><sup>
High-entropy materials represent the state-of-the-art on the alloy design strategy for future applications in extreme environments. Recent data indicates that high-entropy alloys (HEAs) exhibit outstanding radiation resistance in face of existing diluted alloy counterparts due to suppressed damage formation and evolution. An extension of the HEA concept is presented in this paper towards the synthesis and characterization of novel high-entropy ceramics as emergent materials for application in environments where energetic particle irradiation is a major concern. A novel carbide within the quinary refractory system CrNbTaTiW has been synthesized using magnetron-sputtering. The material exhibited nanocrystalline grains, single-phase crystal structure and C content around 50 at.%. Heavy-ion irradiation with in-situ Transmission Electron Microscopy was used to assess the irradiation response of the new high-entropy carbide (HEC) at 573 K and a comparison with the HEA within the system is made. No displacement damage effects appear within the microstructures of both HEA and HEC up to a dose of 10 displacements-per-atom. Surprisingly, the HEC has not amorphized under the investigated conditions. Xe was implanted in both materials and bubbles nucleated, but smaller sizes compared with conventional nuclear materials shedding light they are potential candidates for use in nuclear energy.

March 2023

<sub><sup>
We propose a systematic method to construct crystal-based molecular structures often needed as input for computational chemistry studies. These structures include crystal ``slabs" with periodic boundary conditions (PBCs) and non-periodic solids such as Wulff structures. We also introduce a method to build crystal slabs with orthogonal PBC vectors. These methods are integrated into our code, Los Alamos Crystal Cut (LCC), which is open source and thus fully available to the community. Examples showing the use of these methods are given throughout the manuscript.

**Molecular-Dynamics Analysis of the Mechanical Behavior of Plasma-Facing Tungsten**

Asanka Weerasinghe, <b>Enrique Martínez</b>, Brian D. Wirth, Dimitrios Maroudas

January 2023

<sub><sup>
We report a systematic computational analysis of the mechanical behavior of plasma-facing component (PFC) tungsten focusing on the impact of void and helium (He) bubble defects on the mechanical response beyond the elastic regime. Specifically, we explore the effects of porosity and He atomic fraction on the mechanical properties and structural response of PFC tungsten, at varying temperature and bubble size. We find that the Young modulus of defective tungsten undergoes substantial softening that follows an exponential scaling relation as a function of matrix porosity and He atomic content. Beyond the elastic regime, our high strain rate simulations reveal that the presence of nanoscale spherical defects (empty voids and He bubbles) reduces the yield strength of tungsten in a monotonically decreasing fashion, obeying an exponential scaling relation as a function of tungsten matrix porosity and He concentration. Our detailed analysis of the structural response of PFC tungsten near the yield point reveals that yielding is initiated by emission of dislocation loops from bubble/matrix interfaces, mainly 1/2⟨111⟩ shear loops, followed by gliding and growth of these loops and reactions to form ⟨100⟩ dislocations. Furthermore, dislocation gliding on the ⟨111⟩{211} twin systems nucleates 1/6⟨111⟩ twin regions in the tungsten matrix. These dynamical processes reduce the stress in the matrix substantially. Subsequent dislocation interactions and depletion of the twin phases via nucleation and propagation of detwinning partials lead the tungsten matrix to a next deformation stage characterized by stress increase during applied straining. Our structural analysis reveals that the depletion of twin boundaries (areal defects) is strongly impacted by the density of He bubbles at higher porosities. After the initial stress relief upon yielding, increase in the dislocation density in conjunction with decrease in the areal defect density facilitates the initiation of dislocation-driven deformation mechanisms in the PFC crystal.

<sub><sup>
Short-range order (SRO) in multicomponent concentrated alloys affects their mechanical response. Hence, is paramount to understand how composition modifies the chemical ordering in the system to design materials with optimal properties. We present here a methodology to predict the SRO and thermodynamic properties in chemically complex systems and apply it to the WTaCrVHf quinary alloy. We observe that the addition of Hf significantly modifies the SRO, mainly at intermediate to low temperatures, matching experimental observations.

<sub><sup>
High-entropy materials represent the state-of-the-art on the alloy design strategy for future applications in extreme environments. Recent data indicates that high-entropy alloys (HEAs) exhibit outstanding radiation resistance in face of existing diluted alloy counterparts due to suppressed damage formation and evolution. An extension of the HEA concept is presented in this paper towards the synthesis and characterization of novel high-entropy ceramics as emergent materials for application in environments where energetic particle irradiation is a major concern. A novel carbide within the quinary refractory system CrNbTaTiW has been synthesized using magnetron-sputtering. The material exhibited nanocrystalline grains, singlephase crystal structure and C content around 50 at.%. Heavy-ion irradiation with in-situ Transmission Electron Microscopy was used to assess the irradiation response of the new highentropy carbide (HEC) at 573 K and a comparison with the HEA within the system is made. No displacement damage effects appear within the microstructures of both HEA and HEC up to a dose of 17 displacements-per-atom. Surprisingly, the HEC has not amorphized under the investigated conditions. Xe was implanted in both materials and bubbles nucleated, but smaller sizes compared with conventional nuclear materials shedding light they are potential candidates for use in nuclear energy.

**Volume of a dislocation network**

Max Boleininger, S. L. Dudarev, Daniel R. Mason, <b>Enrique Martínez</b>

June 2022

<sub><sup>
We derive a simple analytical line integral expression for the relaxation volume tensor of an arbitrary interconnected dislocation network. This quantity determines the magnitude of dislocation contribution to the dimensional changes and volumetric swelling of a material, and highlights the fundamental dual role of dislocations as sources of internal strain as well as carriers of plastic deformation. To illustrate applications of the method, we compute the relaxation volume of a stacking fault tetrahedron, a defect commonly occurring in fcc metals; the volume of an unusual tetrahedral configuration formed by the $(a/2)\ensuremath{\langle}111\ensuremath{\rangle}$ and $a\ensuremath{\langle}001\ensuremath{\rangle}$ dislocations in a bcc metal; and estimate the relative contribution of extended dislocations to the volume relaxation of heavily irradiated tungsten.

**Interstitial hydrogen enhances the mobility of some grain boundaries in tungsten**

Nithin Mathew, Danny Pérez, Wonjoon Suk, Blas P. Uberuaga, <b>Enrique Martínez</b>

May 2022

<sub><sup>
Abstract Segregation of interstitials at a grain boundary (GB) is known to generally lower its mobility. This phenomenon, called ‘solute-drag’, has important ramifications on the process of recrystallization and microstructural evolution. In this manuscript, we present predictions from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations which demonstrate that interstitial hydrogen in tungsten can in fact increase the mobility of some GBs which exhibit shear coupling. Assuming a disconnection-based mechanism, activation energies and pre-factors for disconnection nucleation are predicted from simulations of shear-coupled motion. In GBs where enhanced mobility is predicted, interstitial H reduces both the activation energy and the pre-factor for disconnection nucleation, thus effectively increasing the mobility. For GBs with diminished mobility, MD predicts that presence of interstitial H reduces the pre-factor and, in some cases, increases the activation energy. The reduction in the activation energy inferred from MD simulations are confirmed by nudged elastic band calculations. Temperature-dependent structural transitions are observed for some GBs, and the effect of interstitial H is found to change with the changes in structure. The effect of interstitial H is predicted to be complex and highly variable, providing some plausible explanations for experimental observations on the recrystallization of tungsten in presence of H-loaded plasma.

**Atomistic and machine learning studies of solute segregation in metastable grain boundaries**

April 2022

<sub><sup>
The interaction of alloying elements with grain boundaries (GBs) influences many phenomena, such as microstructural evolution and transport. While GB solute segregation has been the subject of active research in recent years, most studies focus on ground-state GB structures, i.e., lowest energy GBs. The impact of GB metastability on solute segregation remains poorly understood. Herein, we leverage atomistic simulations to generate metastable structures for a series of [001] and [110] symmetric tilt GBs in a model Al-Mg system and quantify Mg segregation to individual sites within these boundaries. Our results show large variations in the atomic Voronoi volume due to GB metastability, which are found to influence the segregation energy. The atomistic data are then used to train a Gaussian Process machine learning model, which provides a probabilistic description of the GB segregation energy in terms of the local atomic environment. In broad terms, our approach extends existing GB segregation models by accounting for variability due to GB metastability, where the segregation energy is treated as a distribution rather than a single-valued quantity.

**Influence of stress correlations on dislocation glide in random alloys**

Ali Rida, <b>Enrique Martínez</b>, David Rodney, Pierre-Antoine Geslin

March 2022

<sub><sup>
Solute strengthening is an important mechanism that contributes to improving the mechanical properties of alloys and particularly the recent generations of concentrated alloys. The stress field emerging from an elastic model of a random solid solution displays strongly anisotropic correlations that interact differently with dislocations of different characters. In the present paper, we investigate the depinning transition of edge and screw dislocations evolving in such a correlated stress environment using a dislocation dynamics numerical model. We find that edge dislocations are only weakly affected by the correlations, while screw dislocations are strongly influenced, showing a smaller critical stress, which increases with the amplitude of the stress noise with a larger exponent than the edge dislocation. The numerical results are compared with existing statistical models of solute strengthening, allowing to discuss critically their assumptions.

**Interface Dislocations and Grain Boundary Disconnections Using Smith Normal Bicrystallography**

Nikhil Chandra Admal, <b>Enrique Martínez</b>, Giacomo Po

January 2022

<sub><sup>
The CSL/DSCL model for interfaces in crystalline materials offers a unified framework to study interface dislocations in phase boundaries and disconnections in grain boundaries. The model relies on the existence of a coincidence relation between the two lattices that meet at an interface. The model’s ability to quantitatively predict the thermodynamics and kinetics of interfaces has been demonstrated for a limited set of symmetric tilt grain boundaries (STGBs) in cubic materials and twin boundaries. However, the lack of a general framework of interface defects prevents its applicability to arbitrary rational boundaries. In this paper, we present a mathematical framework based on the Smith normal form (SNF) for integer matrices to study the bicrystallography of rational phase and grain boundaries. One of the main results of the paper is a constructive proof of the invariance of the coincident site lattice (CSL) under discrete relative displacements of the parent lattices (of possibly different kind) by a displacement shift complete lattice (DSCL) vector. In addition, we obtain necessary and sufficient conditions on two lattices, related by not only rotations but also lattice distortions, for the existence of a coincidence relation. We first apply these results to explore coincidence relations in arbitrary phase boundaries, and study interface dislocations. In particular, we demonstrate the framework for a phase boundary formed by a strained hexagonal lattice and a square lattice. As a second application, we show how to enumerate all possible (geometric) disconnection modes in arbitrary rational grain boundaries, including glide and non-glide modes in both STGBs and asymmetric-tilt grain boundaries (ATGBs). The constructive nature of the framework lends itself to an algorithmic implementation based exclusively on integer matrix algebra to construct all interfaces that admit CSLs up to a prescribed size, and determine disconnection modes in grain boundaries. We demonstrate the use of SNF bicrystallography on selected bicrystal misorientation axes/angles in face-centered cubic (fcc), body-centered cubic (bcc), and hexagonal (hex) lattices.

**Thermal gradient effect on helium and self-interstitial transport in tungsten**

<b>Enrique Martínez</b>, Nithin Mathew, Danny Pérez, Sophie Blondel, Dwaipayan Dasgupta, Brian D. Wirth, Dimitrios Maroudas

December 2021

<sub><sup>
First-wall materials in a fusion reactor are expected to withstand harsh conditions, with high heat and particle fluxes that modify the materials microstructure. These fluxes will create strong gradients of temperature and concentration of diverse species. Besides the He ash and the hydrogenic species, neutron particles generated in the fusion reaction will collide with the material creating intrinsic defects, such as vacancies, self-interstitials atoms (SIAs), and clusters of such point defects. These defects and the He atoms will then migrate in the presence of the aforementioned gradients. In this study, we use nonequilibrium molecular dynamics to analyze the transport of He and SIAs in the presence of a thermal gradient in tungsten. We observe that, in all cases, the defects and impurity atoms tend to migrate toward the hot regions of the tungsten sample. The resulting species concentration profiles are exponential distributions, rising toward the hot regions of the sample, in agreement with irreversible thermodynamics analysis. For both He atoms and SIAs, we find that the resulting species flux is directed opposite to the heat flux, indicating that species transport is governed by a Soret effect (thermal-gradient-driven diffusion) characterized by a negative heat of transport that drives species diffusion uphill (from the cooler to the hot regions of the sample). We demonstrate that the steady-state species profiles obtained accounting for the Soret effect vary significantly from those where temperature-gradient-driven transport is not considered and discuss the implications of such a Soret effect on the response to plasma exposure of plasma-facing tungsten.

**A stochastic solver based on the residence time algorithm for crystal plasticity models**

Qianran Yu, <b>Enrique Martínez</b>, Javier Segurado, Jaime Marian

August 2021

<sub><sup>
Abstract The deformation of crystalline materials by dislocation motion takes place in discrete amounts determined by the Burgers vector. Dislocations may move individually or in bundles, potentially giving rise to intermittent slip. This confers plastic deformation with a certain degree of variability that can be interpreted as being caused by stochastic fluctuations in dislocation behavior. However, crystal plasticity (CP) models are almost always formulated in a continuum sense, assuming that fluctuations average out over large material volumes and/or cancel out due to multi-slip contributions. Nevertheless, plastic fluctuations are known to be important in confined volumes at or below the micron scale, at high temperatures, and under low strain rate/stress deformation conditions. Here, we develop a stochastic solver for CP models based on the residence-time algorithm that naturally captures plastic fluctuations by sampling among the set of active slip systems in the crystal. The method solves the evolution equations of explicit CP formulations, which are recast as stochastic ordinary differential equations and integrated discretely in time. The stochastic CP model is numerically stable by design and naturally breaks the symmetry of plastic slip by sampling among the active plastic shear rates with the correct probability. This can lead to phenomena such as intermittent slip or plastic localization without adding external symmetry-breaking operations to the model. The method is applied to body-centered cubic tungsten single crystals under a variety of temperatures, loading orientations, and imposed strain rates.

**Development of a solute and defect concentration dependant Ising model for the study of transmutation induced segregation in neutron irradiated W–(Re, Os) systems**

Matthew J. Lloyd, <b>Enrique Martínez</b>, Luca Messina, D. Nguyen-Manh

August 2021

<sub><sup>
Abstract In this study, radiation-induced precipitation of transmutation products is addressed via the development of a new solute and vacancy concentration dependant Ising model for the W–Re–Os system. This new model includes interactions between both Os and Re atoms with vacancies, thus facilitating more representative simulations of transmutation in fusion reactor components. Local solute concentration dependencies are introduced for the W–Re, W–Os and Re–Os pair interactions. The model correctly accounts for the repulsion between small clusters of vacancies and the attraction between larger clusters/voids, via the introduction of local vacancy concentration dependant interaction coefficients between pairs of atoms and vacancies. To parameterise the pair interactions between atoms and/or vacancies, the enthalpy of mixing, Δ H mix , for various configurations and solute/defect concentrations, was calculated using density functional theory, within 6 binary systems: W–Re, W–Os, Re–Os, W–vacancy, Re–vacancy and Os–vacancy. The new energy model was implemented into the SPPARKS Monte Carlo code, and successfully used to predict the formation of voids decorated with Re and Os solute atoms. Analysis suggests that there is a strong thermodynamic tendency for Os to bind to these voids with a comparatively weaker binding from Re atoms. The binding energies of various solute/vacancy clusters were calculated and showed that Re and Os solute atoms tend to stabilise small clusters of vacancies, increasing the attractive binding energy between the constituents.

**Strain Effects on the Diffusion Properties of Near-Surface Self-Interstitial Atoms and Adatoms in Tungsten**

Bochuan Sun, Dimitrios Maroudas, Brian D. Wirth, <b>Enrique Martínez</b>

July 2021

<sub><sup>
Tungsten (W) is a candidate for the plasma-facing components and divertor in future fusion applications. The material will be subject to a large particle influx (mainly helium and hydrogenic species) that will form bubbles. As bubbles grow, they compress the material, adding to thermal stresses, and eject self-interstitial atoms (SIAs—isolated or in clusters) to release internal pressure. These SIAs diffuse towards the surface in large stress/strain fields and on the surface are thought to act as precursors for nanotendril formation (also known as fuzz) that develops on the material surface modifying its morphology. In this work we analyze the effect of strain on the diffusion properties of both SIAs and adatoms. Relying on atomistic simulations, we compute the average time that a SIA created in the center of a tungsten slab takes to reach a (110) surface for different strains and temperatures. This time relates to the SIA diffusivity and allows to compute the activation energy and dipole tensor including surface effects. We observe a large strain effect that significantly modifies the propensity for SIAs to reach the surface and, hence, to cluster to form dislocation loops in the bulk crystal. Strain also alters the diffusivity of the adatom although to a lesser extent. Finally, we report on the resulting surface roughness evolution and its dependence on strain.

**Relative relevance of mobility and driving force on edge dislocation climb by the vacancy mechanism**

<b>Enrique Martínez</b>, Alankar Alankar, Alfredo Caro, Thomas Jourdan

November 2020

<sub><sup>
In this work we examine the driving force for edge dislocations to climb in $\alpha$-Fe from atomistic and mesoscale viewpoints. We study the bias for the climb process depending on the dislocation orientation and the applied stress as coming from both the gradient of the chemical potential and the transport coefficients. Both terms are modified by the applied stress and therefore contribute to climb. Surprisingly, even though the vacancy migration barrier distribution is modified by the external stress as obtained by nudged-elastic band calculations, the mobilities resulting from a kinetic Monte Carlo model applied on the obtained energy landscape are indistinguishable, independently of the stress. Moreover, an object kinetic Monte Carlo (OKMC) model including the effect of the dislocation strain field to first order shows indeed a slight anisotropic component in the diffusion in more complex dislocation configurations. However, the OKMC results highlight the fact that the thermodynamic component is the dominant driving force. We conclude that in $\alpha$-Fe under thermal conditions, the main source of bias is given by the difference in vacancy chemical potentials, which is small enough to hinder the process for dynamic atomistic simulations.
