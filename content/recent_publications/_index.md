**Active learning of a crystal plasticity flow rule from discrete dislocation dynamics simulations**

Nick Julian, Giacomo Po, <b>Enrique Martínez</b>, Nithin Mathew, Danny Pérez

December 2025

<sub><sup>
Abstract Continuum-scale material deformation models, such as crystal plasticity (CP), can significantly enhance their predictive accuracy by incorporating input from lower-scale (i.e. mesoscale) models. The procedure to generate and extract the relevant information is however typically complex and ad hoc, involving decision and intervention by domain experts, leading to long development times. In this study, we develop a principled approach for calibration of continuum-scale models using lower scale information by representing a CP flow rule as a Gaussian process model. This representation allows for efficient parameter space exploration, guided by the uncertainty embedded in the model through a process known as Bayesian optimization (BO). We demonstrate a semi-autonomous BO loop which instantiates discrete dislocation dynamics simulations whose initial conditions are automatically chosen to optimize the uncertainty of a model CP flow rule. Our self-guided computational pipeline efficiently generated a dataset and corresponding model whose error, uncertainty, and physical feature sensitivities were validated with comparison to an independent dataset four times larger, demonstrating a valuable and efficient active learning implementation readily transferable to similar material systems.

**Thermal gradient effect on hydrogen transport in tungsten**

Sanad Alturk, <b>Jacob Jeffries</b>, Muhammed Kose, <b>Enrique Martínez</b>

<sub><sup>
Abstract One key challenge for efficiency and safety in fusion devices is the retention of tritium (T) in plasma-facing components. Tritium retention generates radioactive concerns and decreases the amount of fuel available to generate power. Hence, understanding the behavior of T in tungsten (W), as the main candidate as armor material, is critical to the deployment of fusion as a reliable energy source. In this work, we have studied the effect of a thermal gradient in the transport properties of hydrogen (as a T surrogate) in pure W. Strong thermal gradients develop in the divertor as a result of the intense energy fluxes arriving at the material. We have developed an analytical approach to compute the heat of transport ( <mml:math xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" overflow="scroll"> <mml:mrow> <mml:msup> <mml:mi>Q</mml:mi> <mml:mo>∗</mml:mo> </mml:msup> </mml:mrow> </mml:math> ) that is parameterized from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. <mml:math xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" overflow="scroll"> <mml:mrow> <mml:msup> <mml:mi>Q</mml:mi> <mml:mo>∗</mml:mo> </mml:msup> </mml:mrow> </mml:math> is a parameter needed in irreversible thermodynamics frameworks to understand mass transport in the presence of thermal gradients.

**Grain boundary metastability controls irradiation resistance in nanocrystalline metals**

<sub><sup>
Grain boundaries (GBs) in polycrystalline materials are powerful sinks for irradiation defects. While standard theories assume that a GB’s efficiency as a sink is defined solely by its character before irradiation, recent evidence conclusively shows that the irradiation sink efficiency is a highly dynamic property controlled by the intrinsic metastability of GBs under far-from-equilibrium irradiation conditions. In this paper, we reveal that the denuded (i.e., defect-free) zone, typically the signature of a strong sink, can collapse as irradiation damage accumulates. We propose a radiation damage evolution model that captures this behavior based on the emergence of a series of irradiation defect-enabled metastable GB microstate changes that dynamically alter the ability of the GB to absorb further damage. We show that these microstate changes control further defect absorption and give rise to the formation of a defect network that manifests itself as a net Nye-tensor signal detectable via lattice curvature experiments.

**A METHODOLOGICAL PROPOSAL TO APPLY THE MONTE-CARLO METHOD TO DIMENSIONAL METROLOGY IN THE INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING FIELD**

MARICARMEN MANJABACAS, J. Plaza, V. Miguel, <b>Enrique Martínez</b>

November 2025

<sub><sup>
The Monte Carlo method (MCM), applied to uncertainty calculation in metrology, is well-suited for nonlinear functions. It also provides more accurate solutions in certain complex linear models. Although MCM is extensively covered in the ISO Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement (GUM) and in metrological guides from reference institutions in various countries, industrial engineering curricula typically only introduce concepts related to uncertainty propagation using the traditional analytical method. MCM requires programming to generate random numbers within the expected range for each variable involved in the metrological system, combining computing tools with metrology. This methodological proposal is based on a basic system for constructing an angle using a sine bar and gauge blocks. The problem progressively incorporates the temperature variable under different behavioural hypotheses and the influence of other factors, such as the roundness tolerance of the sine bar supports. The results obtained using MCM are compared with those from the classical GUM method, and the analysis demonstrates the robustness of MCM from a scientific perspective. Based on this methodology, further challenges could be explored, such as introducing the flatness tolerance of the surface plate used. Keywords: Montecarlo, dimensional metrology, angle construction, influence magnitudes

**Kinetic Monte Carlo prediction of the morphology of pentaerythritol tetranitrate**

<b>Jacob Jeffries</b>, Himanshu Singh, Romain Perriot, Christian F. A. Negre, Antonio Redondo, <b>Enrique Martínez</b>

September 2025

<sub><sup>
In this work, we develop an atomistic, graph-based kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) simulation routine to predict crystal morphology. Within this routine, we encode the state of the supercell in a binary occupation vector and the topology of the supercell in a simple nearest-neighbor graph. From this encoding, we efficiently compute the interaction energy of the system as a quadratic form of the binary occupation vector, representing pairwise interactions. This encoding, coupled with a simple diffusion model for adsorption, is then used to model evaporation and adsorption dynamics at solid-liquid interfaces. The resulting intermolecular interaction-breaking energies are incorporated into a kinetic model to predict crystal morphology, which is implemented in the open-source Python package Crystal Growth Kinetic Monte Carlo (cgkmc). We then apply this routine to pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN), an important energetic material, showing excellent agreement with the attachment energy model.

September 2025

<sub><sup>
The increased availability of computing resources enables next-generation technologies to process large amounts of data, driving the creation of more accurate, efficient, and innovative systems. New tools such as digital twins and artificial intelligence have been shown to speed up development cycles, reduce risks and costs, and create better products in almost all disciplines. The authors believe that many tasks in CSP tower plants can benefit from this new data-driven paradigm. The presentation will focus on examples in which next-generation technologies are applied to optimize the operation and calibration of CSP tower plants.

**Bulk synthesis of radiation resistant W – Ti – Cr – V compositionally complex alloys**

<sub><sup>
Refractory compositionally complex alloys are candidate material systems for next generation advanced nuclear reactors. This work showcases the first successful bulk synthesis of low activation W–Ti based refractory compositionally complex alloys using arc melting and provides insights on using additive manufacturing for these compositions using directed energy deposition. Both techniques produce equiaxed grains composed of a tungsten matrix with Ti–V–Cr dendritic boundaries. The arc melted specimen possesses a multi-modal grain size distribution, while the directed energy deposition specimen possesses a more gaussian distribution of grain size. Both arc melted and directed energy deposition specimens demonstrate high thermal stability up to 900 °C, as well as promising radiation resistance with low loop formation and the presence of homogeneously distributed helium cavities maintaining small diameters at ≥10 dpa under simultaneous light (helium) and heavy (krypton) ion irradiation at 900 °C.

**Dual beam ion irradiation response of low activation thin films of nanocrystalline W-Ti-Based compositionally complex alloys**

September 2025

<sub><sup>
Recently, compositionally complex alloys (CCAs) have been proposed as material candidates for extreme environments, such as for fission or fusion. To explore low activation designed W-Ti-based CCA systems, two new nanocrystalline CCA thin films were synthesized. Single-phase BCC ternary W–Ti–V and quaternary W–Ti–Cr–V CCAs were subjected to in-situ heating and dual-beam ion irradiation investigations at 900 °C. After exposure to 900 °C with and without ion irradiation both systems exhibited negligible grain growth. Small (≤ 1 nm) cavities distributed throughout the film were observed with no radiation induced loop formation post dual-beam ion irradiation up to ∼ 13 dpa. These responses are in excellent agreement with atomistic modeling. Compared to other candidate material systems, these systems possess impressive thermal stabilities and irradiation resistances, while serving as low activation alternatives to W–Ta–based compositionally complex alloys for extreme environments.

**Design kinetic parameters for improved resilience of materials under irradiation**

<b>Mohammadhossein Nahavandian</b>, Eda Aydogan, Jesper Byggmästar, Matheus A. Tunes, Osman El‐Atwani, <b>Enrique Martínez</b>

July 2025

<sub><sup>
High entropy alloys (HEAs) have captured much attention in recent years due to their conceivably improved radiation resistance compared to pure metals, terminal solid solution alloys and traditional nuclear materials. However, among HEAs, there are millions of design possibilities considering all potential compositions. In this study, we develop criteria to design HEAs with improved radiation resilience taking into consideration defect properties to promote interstitial-vacancy recombination. First, we conduct rate theory calculations on defects followed by Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations on pure W and W-based multicomponent concentrated alloys. It is found that when the diffusion coefficients for single vacancies and interstitials become similar and the effective migration energies of defects are minimum (maximum diffusivities), defect recombination becomes optimal, and the concentration of defects is significantly reduced. This is supported by MD simulations indicating improved radiation resistance of V- and Cr-based alloys, which satisfy the above-stated criteria. Furthermore, experimental observations also reinforce the proposed approach. This study sheds light on the design criteria for improved radiation resistance and helps material selection without the need of extensive experimental work.

**Atomic Structure of the Lithium–Lithium Oxide Interface from First Principles**

Giovanni Orlandi, Jun Li, S.D. Kenny, <b>Enrique Martínez</b>

March 2025

<sub><sup>
While lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) have been largely commercialized as the rechargeable battery of choice, their liquid electrolyte limits the theoretical energy density of the battery and poses serious safety threats. Solid-state lithium batteries (SSLBs) use a solid electrolyte, which can provide much higher energy densities and better safety than LIBs. The adoption of SSLBs is held back by interactions that occur between the electrolyte and anode, such as high resistance to lithium (Li) ion flow and the growth of Li dendrites that lead to short circuits. This paper focuses on understanding the interface between oxide electrolytes and Li metal anodes with the goal of predicting the structure and properties dictated by the interface. By comparing interface energies for different orientations of Li and lithium oxide (Li<sub>2</sub>O), a primary component of the solid electrolyte interphase, the Li<sub>2</sub>O(110) surface was found to be the most energetically favorable. Furthermore, bonding between the metallic Li and the oxygen atoms on the Li<sub>2</sub>O(110) plane was observed to be more impactful on stability than the lattice strain. As a consequence, the lowest energy interface was obtained by introducing FCC Li between Li<sub>2</sub>O and BCC Li.

**High Radiation Resistance in the Binary W‐Ta System Through Small V Additions: A New Paradigm for Nuclear Fusion Materials**

<sub><sup>
Abstract Refractory High‐Entropy Alloys (RHEAs) are promising candidates for structural materials in nuclear fusion reactors, where W‐based alloys are currently leading. Fusion materials must withstand extreme conditions, including i) severe radiation damage from energetic neutrons, ii) embrittlement due to H and He ion implantation, and iii) exposure to high temperatures and thermal gradients. Recent RHEAs, such as WTaCrV and WTaCrVHf, have shown superior radiation tolerance and microstructural stability compared to pure W, but their multi‐element compositions complicate bulk fabrication and limit practical use. In this study, it is demonstrated that reducing alloying elements in RHEAs is feasible without compromising radiation tolerance. Herein, two Highly Concentrated Refractory Alloys (HCRAs) − W 53 Ta 44 V 3 and W 53 Ta 42 V 5 (at.%) − were synthesized and investigated. We found that small V additions significantly influence the radiation response of the binary W–Ta system. Experimental results, supported by ab‐initio Monte Carlo simulations and machine‐learning‐driven molecular dynamics, reveal that minor variations in V content enhance Ta–V chemical short‐range order (CSRO), improving radiation resistance in the W 53 Ta 42 V 5 HCRA. By focusing on reducing chemical complexity and the number of alloying elements, the conventional high‐entropy alloy paradigm is challenged, suggesting a new approach to designing simplified multi‐component alloys with refractory properties for thermonuclear fusion applications.

December 2024

<sub><sup>
Tungsten-based low-activation high-entropy alloys are possible candidates for next-generation fusion reactors due to their exceptional tolerance to irradiation, thermal loads, and stress. We develop an accurate and efficient machine-learned interatomic potential for the W-Ta-Cr-V system and use it in hybrid Monte Carlo molecular dynamics simulations of ordering and segregation to all common types of defects in WTaCrV. The predictions are compared to atom probe tomography analysis of segregation and precipitation in WTaCrV thin films. By also considering two other alloys, WTaV and MoNbTaVW, we are able to draw general conclusions about preferred segregation in refractory alloys and the reasons behind it, guiding future alloy design and elucidating experimental observations. We show that the experimentally observed CrV precipitates in WTaCrV form semicoherent bcc-to-bcc interfaces with the surrounding matrix, as coherent precipitates are not thermodynamically stable due to excessive lattice mismatch. The predictions from simulations align well with our atom probe tomography analysis as well as previous experimental observations.

Refractory High-Entropy Alloys (RHEAs) hold promising potential to be used as structural materials in future nuclear fusion reactors, where W and its alloys are currently leading candidates. Fusion materials must be able to withstand extreme conditions, such as (i) severe radiation-damage arising from highly-energetic neutrons, (ii) embrittlement caused by implantation of H and He ions, and (iii) exposure to extreme high-temperatures and thermal gradients. Recent research demonstrated that two RHEAs - the WTaCrV and WTaCrVHf - can outperform both coarse-grained and nanocrystalline W in terms of its radiation response and microstructural stability. Chemical complexity and nanocrystallinity enhance the radiation tolerance of these new RHEAs, but their multi-element nature, including low-melting Cr, complicates bulk fabrication and limits practical applications. We demonstrate that reducing the number of alloying elements and yet retain high-radiation tolerance is possible within the ternary system W-Ta-V via synthesis of two novel nanocrystalline refractory medium-entropy alloys (RMEAs): the W$_{53}$Ta$_{44}$V$_{3}$ and W$_{53}$Ta$_{42}$V$_{5}$ (in at.\%). We experimentally show that the radiation response of the W-Ta-V system can be tailored by small additions of V, and such experimental result was validated with theoretical analysis of chemical short-range orders (CSRO) from combined ab-initio atomistic Monte-Carlo modeling. It is predicted from computational analysis that a small change in V concentration has a significant effect on the Ta-V CRSO between W$_{53}$Ta$_{44}$V$_{3}$ and W$_{53}$Ta$_{42}$V$_{5}$ leading to radiation-resistant microstructures in these RMEAs from chemistry stand-point of views. We deviate from the original high-entropy alloy concept to show that high radiation resistance can be achieved in systems with simplified chemical complexity.

In this work we studied the effects of 20 keV collision cascades in alpha iron with a 1∕2⟨111⟩{110} edge dipole using molecular dynamics. We analysed three different cases: a) the primary knock-on atom (PKA) is centred between both dislocations, b) the PKA is closer to one of the dislocations, and c) the PKA is on top of one of the dislocations and directed towards it. Our calculations show enhanced formation of vacancy clusters in the bulk for intermediate distances due to the absorption of self-interstitials by the dislocation during the collision cascade reducing the recombination between vacancies and self-interstitials. This effect results in the formation of jogs at the dislocation and the consequent climb due to the absorption of the self-interstitials. As a result, there is an unbalance between vacancies and self-interstitials produced by the collision cascade, with a significantly larger number of vacancies than self-interstitials in the bulk and the formation of large vacancy clusters. When the collision cascade develops directly on top of the dislocation, jogs are formed due to both the absorption of vacancies and self-interstitials, inducing climb and with the total dislocation length increasing up to several nanometers.

Grain boundaries (GBs) in polycrystalline materials are powerful sinks for irradiation defects. While standard theories assume that the sink efficiency of a grain boundary is defined solely by its character before irradiation, recent evidence conclusively shows that the irradiation sink efficiency is a highly dynamic property controlled by the intrinsic metastability of GBs under far-from-equilibrium irradiation conditions. In this paper, we reveal that the denuded (i.e., defect-free) zone, typically the signature of a strong sink, can collapse as irradiation damage accumulates. We propose a radiation damage evolution model that captures this behavior based on the emergence of a series of irradiation defect-enabled metastable GB microstate changes that dynamically alter the ability of the GB to absorb further damage. We show that these microstate changes control further defect absorption and give rise to the formation of a defect network that manifests itself as a net Nye-tensor signal detectable via lattice curvature experiments.

**Data-Driven Modeling of Dislocation Mobility from Atomistics using Physics-Informed Machine Learning**

April 2024

<sub><sup>
<title>Abstract</title> Dislocation mobility, which dictates the response of dislocations to an applied stress, is a fundamental property of crystalline materials that governs the evolution of plastic deformation. Traditional approaches for deriving mobility laws rely on phenomenological models of the underlying physics, whose free parameters are in turn fitted to a small number of intuition-driven atomic scale simulations under varying conditions of temperature and stress. This tedious and time-consuming approach becomes particularly cumbersome for materials with complex dependencies on stress, temperature, and local environment, such as body-centered cubic crystals (BCC) metals and alloys. In this paper, we present a novel, uncertainty quantification-driven active learning paradigm for learning dislocation mobility laws from automated high-throughput large-scale molecular dynamics simulations, using Graph Neural Networks (GNN) with a physics-informed architecture. We demonstrate that this Physics-informed Graph Neural Network (PI-GNN) framework captures the underlying physics more accurately compared to existing phenomenological mobility laws in BCC metals.

**Primary Defect Production in Doped Iron Grain Boundaries during Low Energy Collision Cascades**

Yang Zhang, Blas P. Uberuaga, <b>Enrique Martínez</b>, Jason R. Trelewicz

March 2024

<sub><sup>
This study explores the intricate interactions between grain boundaries (GBs) and irradiation-induced defects in nanocrystalline iron, highlighting the role of dopants like copper. Utilizing molecular dynamics simulations, the research delineates how GB properties, such as GB energy and defect formation energies, influence the formation and evolution of defects in low energy collision cascades. It reveals that GBs not only augment defect production but also show a marked preference for interstitials over vacancies, a behavior significantly modulated by the cascade's proximity to the GB. The presence of dopants is shown to alter GB properties, affecting both the rate and type of defect production, thereby underscoring the complex interplay between GB characteristics, dopant elements, and defect dynamics. Moreover, the investigation uncovers that the structural characteristics of GBs play a crucial role in cascade evolution and defect generation, with certain GB configurations undergoing reconfiguration in response to cascades. For instance, the reconfiguration of one pure Fe twist GB suggests that GB geometry can significantly influence defect generation mechanisms. These findings point to the potential of GB engineering in developing materials with enhanced radiation tolerance, advocating for a nuanced approach to material design. By tailoring GB properties and selectively introducing dopant elements, materials can be optimized to exhibit superior resistance to radiation-induced damage, offering insights for applications in nuclear reactors and other radiation-prone environments.

**Stochastic Integration of the Cahn-Hilliard Phase Field Equations**

Qianran Yu, Nick Julian, Jaime Marian, <b>Enrique Martínez</b>

February 2024

<sub><sup>
In this work we develop a stochastic algorithm to integrate the Cahn-Hilliard equations. The algorithm is based on Gillespie's stochastic simulation algorithm, also known as kinetic Monte Carlo. The deterministic integration of the phase field equations leads to the closest minimum of free energy and does not overcome free energy barriers. However, in the nucleation and growth regime of the phase diagram, free energy barriers need to be thermally overcome for the system to phase separate to reach equilibrium. We show in this work that the proposed stochastic integration algorithm indeed allows the system to overcome free energy barriers. We discuss the results in terms of fluctuation distributions, grid sizes and efficiency.

**Prediction of defect properties in concentrated solid solutions using a Langmuir-like model**

<b>Jacob Jeffries</b>, <b>Enrique Martínez</b>, Mathaudhu, Suveen, Marquis, Emmanuelle, Martinez, Enrique

February 2024

<sub><sup>
The alleged existence of sluggish diffusion in high entropy alloys has drawn controversy. In high entropy alloys, and in general in all solids, transport properties are controlled by point defect concentration, which must be known before performing atomistic simulations to compute transport coefficients. In this work, we present a general Langmuir-like model for defect concentration in an arbitrarily complex solid solution and apply this model to generate expressions for concentrations of vacancies and small interstitial atoms. We then calculate the vacancy concentration as a function of temperature in the equiatomic CoNiCrFeMn and FeAl alloys with modified embedded-atom-method potentials for various chemical orderings, showing there is no clear correlation between vacancy thermodynamics and chemical ordering in the CoNiCrFeMn alloy but clear systematic patterns for FeAl. We believe this is due to the high stability of disordered, random and ordered, intermetallic phases respectively in the CoNiCrFeMn and FeAl systems. This work provides future avenues to the prediction of thermal interstitials and vacancies in solid solutions, which is necessary for models of non-equilibrium behavior of solid solutions.

**Synchronous parallel kinetic Monte Carlo Diffusion in Heterogeneous Systems**

<b>Enrique Martínez</b>

February 2024

<sub><sup>
A new hybrid Molecular Dynamics-kinetic Monte Carlo algorithm has been developed in order to study the basic mechanisms taking place in diffusion in concentrated alloys under the action of chemical and stress fields. Parallel implementation of the k-MC part based on a recently developed synchronous algorithm [1. Compo Phys. 227 (2008) 3804-3823] resorting on the introduction of a set of null events aiming at synchronizing the time for the different subdomains, added to the parallel efficiency of MD, provides the computer power required to evaluate jump rates 'on the flight', incorporating in this way the actual driving force emerging from chemical potential gradients, and the actual environment-dependent jump rates. The time gain has been analyzed and the parallel performance reported. The algorithm is tested on simple diffusion problems to verify its accuracy.

**From anti-Arrhenius to Arrhenius behavior in a dislocation-obstacle bypass: Atomistic Simulations and Theoretical Investigation**

January 2024

<sub><sup>
Dislocations are the primary carriers of plasticity in metallic material. Understanding the basic mechanisms for dislocation movement is paramount to predicting the material mechanical response. Relying on atomistic simulations, we observe a transition from non-Arrhenius to Arrhenius behavior in the rate for an edge dislocation to overcome the elastic interaction with a prismatic loop in tungsten. Beyond the critical resolved shear stress, the process shows a non-Arrhenius behavior at low temperatures. However, as the temperature increases, the activation entropy starts to dominate, leading to a traditional Arrhenius behavior. We have computed the activation entropy analytically along the minimum energy path following Schoeck's methods [1], which capture the cross-over between anti-Arrhenius and Arrhenius domains. Also, the Projected Average Force Integrator (PAFI) [2], another simulation method to compute free energies along an initial transition path, exhibits considerable concurrence with Schoeck's formalism. We conclude that entropic effects need to be considered to understand processes involving dislocations bypassing elastic barriers close to the critical resolved shear stress. More work needs to be performed to fully understand the discrepancies between Schoeck's and PAFI results compared to molecular dynamics.
