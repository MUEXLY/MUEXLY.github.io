**Atomic Structure of the Lithium–Lithium Oxide Interface from First Principles**

Giovanni Orlandi, Jun Li, S.D. Kenny, <b>Enrique Martínez</b>

March 2025

<sub><sup>
While lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) have been largely commercialized as the rechargeable battery of choice, their liquid electrolyte limits the theoretical energy density of the battery and poses serious safety threats. Solid-state lithium batteries (SSLBs) use a solid electrolyte, which can provide much higher energy densities and better safety than LIBs. The adoption of SSLBs is held back by interactions that occur between the electrolyte and anode, such as high resistance to lithium (Li) ion flow and the growth of Li dendrites that lead to short circuits. This paper focuses on understanding the interface between oxide electrolytes and Li metal anodes with the goal of predicting the structure and properties dictated by the interface. By comparing interface energies for different orientations of Li and lithium oxide (Li2O), a primary component of the solid electrolyte interphase, the Li2O(110) surface was found to be the most energetically favorable. Furthermore, bonding between the metallic Li and the oxygen atoms on the Li2O(110) plane was observed to be more impactful on stability than the lattice strain. As a consequence, the lowest energy interface was obtained by introducing FCC Li between Li2O and BCC Li.

**Prediction of defect properties in concentrated solid solutions using a Langmuir-like model**

<b>Jacob Jeffries</b>, Fadi Abdeljawad, Suveen N. Mathaudhu, Emmanuelle A. Marquis, <b>Enrique Martínez</b>

March 2025

<sub><sup>
The alleged existence of sluggish diffusion in high-entropy alloys has drawn controversy. In high-entropy alloys and, in general, in all solids, transport properties are controlled by point defect concentration, which must be known before performing atomistic simulations to compute transport coefficients. In this work, we present a general Langmuir-like model for defect concentration in an arbitrarily complex solid solution and apply this model to generate expressions for concentrations of vacancies and small interstitial atoms. We then calculate the vacancy concentration as a function of temperature in the equiatomic CoNiCrFeMn and FeAl alloys with modified embedded-atom-method potentials for various chemical orderings, showing there is no clear correlation between vacancy thermodynamics and chemical ordering in the CoNiCrFeMn alloy, but clear systematic patterns for FeAl. We believe this is due to the high stability of disordered, random, and ordered intermetallic phases, respectively, in the CoNiCrFeMn and FeAl systems. This work provides future avenues to the prediction of thermal interstitials and vacancies in solid solutions, which is necessary for models of nonequilibrium behavior of solid solutions.

**High Radiation Resistance in the Binary W‐Ta System Through Small V Additions: A New Paradigm for Nuclear Fusion Materials**

March 2025

<sub><sup>
Refractory High-Entropy Alloys (RHEAs) are promising candidates for structural materials in nuclear fusion reactors, where W-based alloys are currently leading. Fusion materials must withstand extreme conditions, including i) severe radiation damage from energetic neutrons, ii) embrittlement due to H and He ion implantation, and iii) exposure to high temperatures and thermal gradients. Recent RHEAs, such as WTaCrV and WTaCrVHf, have shown superior radiation tolerance and microstructural stability compared to pure W, but their multi-element compositions complicate bulk fabrication and limit practical use. In this study, it is demonstrated that reducing alloying elements in RHEAs is feasible without compromising radiation tolerance. Herein, two Highly Concentrated Refractory Alloys (HCRAs) - W53Ta44V3 and W53Ta42V5 (at.%) - were synthesized and investigated. We found that small V additions significantly influence the radiation response of the binary W-Ta system. Experimental results, supported by ab-initio Monte Carlo simulations and machine-learning-driven molecular dynamics, reveal that minor variations in V content enhance Ta-V chemical short-range order (CSRO), improving radiation resistance in the W53Ta42V5 HCRA. By focusing on reducing chemical complexity and the number of alloying elements, the conventional high-entropy alloy paradigm is challenged, suggesting a new approach to designing simplified multi-component alloys with refractory properties for thermonuclear fusion applications.

**Segregation, ordering, and precipitation in refractory alloys**

Jesper Byggmästar, Damian Sobieraj, Jan Wróbel, Daniel K. Schreiber, Osman El‐Atwani, <b>Enrique Martínez</b>, D. Nguyen-Manh

December 2024

<sub><sup>
Tungsten-based low-activation high-entropy alloys are possible candidates for next-generation fusion reactors due to their exceptional tolerance to irradiation, thermal loads, and stress. We develop an accurate and efficient machine-learned interatomic potential for the W-Ta-Cr-V system and use it in hybrid Monte Carlo molecular dynamics simulations of ordering and segregation to all common types of defects in WTaCrV. The predictions are compared to atom probe tomography analysis of segregation and precipitation in WTaCrV thin films. By also considering two other alloys, WTaV and MoNbTaVW, we are able to draw general conclusions about preferred segregation in refractory alloys and the reasons behind it, guiding future alloy design and elucidating experimental observations. We show that the experimentally observed CrV precipitates in WTaCrV form semicoherent bcc-to-bcc interfaces with the surrounding matrix, as coherent precipitates are not thermodynamically stable due to excessive lattice mismatch. The predictions from simulations align well with our atom probe tomography analysis as well as previous experimental observations.

**Design Kinetic Parameters for Improved Resilience of Materials under
  Irradiation**

<b>Mohammadhossein Nahavandian</b>, Eda Aydogan, Jesper Byggmästar, Matheus A. Tunes, <b>Enrique Martínez</b>, Osman El‐Atwani

December 2024

<sub><sup>
High entropy alloys (HEAs) have captured much attention in recent years due to their conceivably improved radiation resistance compared to pure metals and traditional alloys. However, among HEAs, there are millions of design possibilities considering all potential compositions. In this study, we develop criteria to design HEAs with improved radiation resilience taking into consideration defect properties to promote interstitial-vacancy recombination. First, we conduct rate theory calculations on defects followed by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations on pure W and W-based multicomponent concentrated alloys. It is found that when the diffusion coefficients for single vacancies and interstitials become similar and the effective migration energies of defects is minimum (maximum diffusivities), defect recombination becomes optimal, and the concentration of defects is significantly reduced. This is supported by MD simulations indicating improved radiation resistance of V- and Cr-based alloys, which satisfy the above-stated criteria. Furthermore, experimental observations also reinforce the proposed approach. This study sheds light on the design criteria for improved radiation resistance and helps material selection without the need of extensive experimental work.

**Enhancing Irradiation Resistance in Refractory Medium Entropy Alloys
  with Simplified Chemistry**

<sub><sup>
Refractory High-Entropy Alloys (RHEAs) hold promising potential to be used as structural materials in future nuclear fusion reactors, where W and its alloys are currently leading candidates. Fusion materials must be able to withstand extreme conditions, such as (i) severe radiation-damage arising from highly-energetic neutrons, (ii) embrittlement caused by implantation of H and He ions, and (iii) exposure to extreme high-temperatures and thermal gradients. Recent research demonstrated that two RHEAs - the WTaCrV and WTaCrVHf - can outperform both coarse-grained and nanocrystalline W in terms of its radiation response and microstructural stability. Chemical complexity and nanocrystallinity enhance the radiation tolerance of these new RHEAs, but their multi-element nature, including low-melting Cr, complicates bulk fabrication and limits practical applications. We demonstrate that reducing the number of alloying elements and yet retain high-radiation tolerance is possible within the ternary system W-Ta-V via synthesis of two novel nanocrystalline refractory medium-entropy alloys (RMEAs): the W$_{53}$Ta$_{44}$V$_{3}$ and W$_{53}$Ta$_{42}$V$_{5}$ (in at.\%). We experimentally show that the radiation response of the W-Ta-V system can be tailored by small additions of V, and such experimental result was validated with theoretical analysis of chemical short-range orders (CSRO) from combined ab-initio atomistic Monte-Carlo modeling. It is predicted from computational analysis that a small change in V concentration has a significant effect on the Ta-V CRSO between W$_{53}$Ta$_{44}$V$_{3}$ and W$_{53}$Ta$_{42}$V$_{5}$ leading to radiation-resistant microstructures in these RMEAs from chemistry stand-point of views. We deviate from the original high-entropy alloy concept to show that high radiation resistance can be achieved in systems with simplified chemical complexity.

**Influence of the distance of a collisional cascade to an edge dipole in <mml:math xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" altimg="si2.svg" display="inline" id="d1e435"><mml:mi>α</mml:mi></mml:math>-Fe on dislocation mobility and defect production**

April 2024

<sub><sup>
In this work we studied the effects of 20 keV collision cascades in alpha iron with a 1/2〈111〉{110} edge dipole using molecular dynamics. We analysed three different cases: a) the primary knock-on atom (PKA) is centered between both dislocations, b) the PKA is closer to one of the dislocations, and c) the PKA is on top of one of the dislocations and directed towards it. Our calculations show enhanced formation of vacancy clusters in the bulk for intermediate distances due to the absorption of self-interstitials by the dislocation during the collision cascade reducing the recombination between vacancies and self-interstitials. This effect results in the formation of jogs at the dislocation and the consequent climb due to the absorption of the self-interstitials. As a result, there is an unbalance between vacancies and self-interstitials produced by the collision cascade, with a significantly larger number of vacancies than self-interstitials in the bulk and the formation of large vacancy clusters. When the collision cascade develops directly on top of the dislocation, jogs are formed due to both the absorption of vacancies and self-interstitials, inducing climb and with the total dislocation length increasing up to several nanometers.

**Grain boundary metastability controls irradiation resistance in
  nanocrystalline metals**

<sub><sup>
Grain boundaries (GBs) in polycrystalline materials are powerful sinks for irradiation defects. While standard theories assume that the sink efficiency of a grain boundary is defined solely by its character before irradiation, recent evidence conclusively shows that the irradiation sink efficiency is a highly dynamic property controlled by the intrinsic metastability of GBs under far-from-equilibrium irradiation conditions. In this paper, we reveal that the denuded (i.e., defect-free) zone, typically the signature of a strong sink, can collapse as irradiation damage accumulates. We propose a radiation damage evolution model that captures this behavior based on the emergence of a series of irradiation defect-enabled metastable GB microstate changes that dynamically alter the ability of the GB to absorb further damage. We show that these microstate changes control further defect absorption and give rise to the formation of a defect network that manifests itself as a net Nye-tensor signal detectable via lattice curvature experiments.

**Data-Driven Modeling of Dislocation Mobility from Atomistics using Physics-Informed Machine Learning**

April 2024

<sub><sup>
<title>Abstract</title> Dislocation mobility, which dictates the response of dislocations to an applied stress, is a fundamental property of crystalline materials that governs the evolution of plastic deformation. Traditional approaches for deriving mobility laws rely on phenomenological models of the underlying physics, whose free parameters are in turn fitted to a small number of intuition-driven atomic scale simulations under varying conditions of temperature and stress. This tedious and time-consuming approach becomes particularly cumbersome for materials with complex dependencies on stress, temperature, and local environment, such as body-centered cubic crystals (BCC) metals and alloys. In this paper, we present a novel, uncertainty quantification-driven active learning paradigm for learning dislocation mobility laws from automated high-throughput large-scale molecular dynamics simulations, using Graph Neural Networks (GNN) with a physics-informed architecture. We demonstrate that this Physics-informed Graph Neural Network (PI-GNN) framework captures the underlying physics more accurately compared to existing phenomenological mobility laws in BCC metals.

**Primary Defect Production in Doped Iron Grain Boundaries during Low
  Energy Collision Cascades**

Yang Zhang, Blas P. Uberuaga, <b>Enrique Martínez</b>, Jason R. Trelewicz

March 2024

<sub><sup>
This study explores the intricate interactions between grain boundaries (GBs) and irradiation-induced defects in nanocrystalline iron, highlighting the role of dopants like copper. Utilizing molecular dynamics simulations, the research delineates how GB properties, such as GB energy and defect formation energies, influence the formation and evolution of defects in low energy collision cascades. It reveals that GBs not only augment defect production but also show a marked preference for interstitials over vacancies, a behavior significantly modulated by the cascade's proximity to the GB. The presence of dopants is shown to alter GB properties, affecting both the rate and type of defect production, thereby underscoring the complex interplay between GB characteristics, dopant elements, and defect dynamics. Moreover, the investigation uncovers that the structural characteristics of GBs play a crucial role in cascade evolution and defect generation, with certain GB configurations undergoing reconfiguration in response to cascades. For instance, the reconfiguration of one pure Fe twist GB suggests that GB geometry can significantly influence defect generation mechanisms. These findings point to the potential of GB engineering in developing materials with enhanced radiation tolerance, advocating for a nuanced approach to material design. By tailoring GB properties and selectively introducing dopant elements, materials can be optimized to exhibit superior resistance to radiation-induced damage, offering insights for applications in nuclear reactors and other radiation-prone environments.

**Stochastic Integration of the Cahn-Hilliard Phase Field Equations**

Qianran Yu, Nick Julian, Jaime Marian, <b>Enrique Martínez</b>

February 2024

<sub><sup>
In this work we develop a stochastic algorithm to integrate the Cahn-Hilliard equations. The algorithm is based on Gillespie's stochastic simulation algorithm, also known as kinetic Monte Carlo. The deterministic integration of the phase field equations leads to the closest minimum of free energy and does not overcome free energy barriers. However, in the nucleation and growth regime of the phase diagram, free energy barriers need to be thermally overcome for the system to phase separate to reach equilibrium. We show in this work that the proposed stochastic integration algorithm indeed allows the system to overcome free energy barriers. We discuss the results in terms of fluctuation distributions, grid sizes and efficiency.

High-entropy alloys have drawn recent interest for their promising mechanical properties and irradiation resistance.

**From anti-Arrhenius to Arrhenius behavior in a dislocation-obstacle bypass: Atomistic Simulations and Theoretical Investigation**

<b>Mohammadhossein Nahavandian</b>, Soumit Sarkar, Soumendu Bagchi, Danny Pérez, <b>Enrique Martínez</b>

January 2024

<sub><sup>
Dislocations are the primary carriers of plasticity in metallic material. Understanding the basic mechanisms for dislocation movement is paramount to predicting the material mechanical response. Relying on atomistic simulations, we observe a transition from non-Arrhenius to Arrhenius behavior in the rate for an edge dislocation to overcome the elastic interaction with a prismatic loop in tungsten. Beyond the critical resolved shear stress, the process shows a non-Arrhenius behavior at low temperatures. However, as the temperature increases, the activation entropy starts to dominate, leading to a traditional Arrhenius behavior. We have computed the activation entropy analytically along the minimum energy path following Schoeck's methods [1], which capture the cross-over between anti-Arrhenius and Arrhenius domains. Also, the Projected Average Force Integrator (PAFI) [2], another simulation method to compute free energies along an initial transition path, exhibits considerable concurrence with Schoeck's formalism. We conclude that entropic effects need to be considered to understand processes involving dislocations bypassing elastic barriers close to the critical resolved shear stress. More work needs to be performed to fully understand the discrepancies between Schoeck's and PAFI results compared to molecular dynamics.

**Shock wave induced migration of an edge dislocation dipole in alpha-Fe**

Santiago Heredia‐Avalos, Cristian D. Denton, Juan Carlos Moreno‐Marín, <b>Enrique Martínez</b>, M.J. Caturla

December 2023

<sub><sup>
The mobility of a 1/2〈111〉{110} edge dipole in alpha-iron has been studied using molecular dynamics simulations. Collision cascades generated by keV recoils have been shown to induce the migration of dislocations. In order to elucidate the origin of the motion of these dislocations, and separate the production of defects from temperature or pressure effects, a stressed region of different shapes (sphere and cylinder) is simulated close to the edge dipole. We observe that the generated shock wave triggers the movement of the dislocations even when no defects are produced. The shape of the distorted region and the character of the dislocations influence the way the dislocations move, due to the change in Peach-Koehler force direction and to the fact that the shock waves arrive to the different parts of the dislocations at different times.

This study aims to compare the effects of neutron and self-ion irradiation on the mechanical properties and microstructural evolution in W. Neutron irradiation at the HFR reactor to 1.67 dpa at 800 °C resulted in the formation of large Re and Os rich clusters and voids. The post-irradiation composition was measured using APT and verfified against FISPACT modelling. The measured Re and Os concentration was used to create alloys with equivalent concentrations of Re and Os. These alloys were exposed to self-ion irradiation to a peak dose of 1.7 dpa at 800 °C. APT showed that self-ion irradiation leads to the formation of small Os clusters, wheras under neutron irradiation large Re/Os clusters form. Voids are formed by both ion and neutron irradiation, but the voids formed by neutron irradiation are larger. By comparing the behaviour of W-1.4Re and W-1.4Re-0.1Os, suppression of Re cluster formation was observed. Irradiation hardening was measured using nanoindentation and was found to be 2.7 GPa, after neutron irradiation and 1.6 GPa and 0.6 GPa for the self-ion irradiated W-1.4Re and W-1.4Re-0.1Os. The higher hardening is attributed to the barrier strength of large voids and Re/Os clusters that are observed after neutron irradiation.

**A novel route to fibers with volatile crystalline semiconductor cores part 2: Selenides and phosphides**

<sub><sup>
The flux assisted molten core method, previously employed to fabricate glass-clad crystalline GaAs core fiber, is applied here to realize crystalline selenide and phosphide cores. These semiconductor families show great promise in photonics, optoelectronics, and thermoelectrics, although their volatility has previously prohibited successful fabrication utilizing the conventional molten core method. Through the introduction of a flux, the alloy melt temperature and associated vapor pressure can be sufficiently reduced to permit thermal drawing of the melt inside a glass cladding into fiber. Reported here are demonstrations of crystalline selenide and phosphide cores. Also reported is the CO2 laser post processing of a ZnSe core fluxed with Cu8GeSe6, which resulted in lateral segregation of the ZnSe phase from the flux. X-ray diffraction and electron microscopy were deployed to determine the resulting ZnSe, InP and flux alloy phases and elemental distributions in the fiber core. X-ray diffraction of the InP: flux and most of the ZnSe: flux systems showed intermetallic flux phases that were not present on the phase diagrams reported in the literature. Formation enthalpy and phase diagrams of the intermetallic phases at room temperature were used to determine which observed phases were thermodynamically stable or meta-stable. The results indicate that the influences at play are primarily thermodynamic, but in some cases, kinetics plays a role during the fabrication of these fibers, forming metastable phases. Lastly, a review and discussion of the new demands on cladding glasses is presented for laser post-processing such fibers. This work demonstrates an approach to incorporating volatile and incongruently melting phases, that are not compatible with the standard molten core method, to realize novel in-fiber optoelectronic compositions.

**Impact of Soret effect on hydrogen and helium retention in PFC tungsten under ELM-like conditions**

<sub><sup>
Abstract In our previous work, we have demonstrated using nonequilibrium molecular-dynamics simulations that the fluxes of helium and self-interstitial atoms in the presence of a thermal gradient in tungsten are directed opposite to the heat flux, indicating that species transport is governed by a Soret effect, namely, thermal-gradient-driven diffusion, characterized by a negative heat of transport that drives species transport uphill, i.e. from the cooler to the hot regions of the tungsten sample. In this work, the findings of our thermal and species transport analysis have been implemented in our cluster-dynamics code, Xolotl, which has been used to compute temperature and species profiles over spatiotemporal scales representative of plasma-facing component (PFC) tungsten under typical reactor operating conditions, including extreme heat loads at the plasma-facing surface characteristic of plasma instabilities that induce edge localized modes (ELMs). We demonstrate that the steady-state species profiles, when properly accounting for the Soret effect, vary significantly from those where temperature-gradient-driven transport is not accounted for and discuss the implications of such a Soret effect on the response to plasma exposure of plasma-facing tungsten. Although our cluster-dynamics simulations do not yet include self-clustering of helium or hydrogen blister formation, our simulation results show that the Soret effect substantially reduces helium and hydrogenic species retention inside PFC tungsten.

<sub><sup>
In nanocrystalline high entropy alloys (HEAs), the difference in chemistry and the density of interfaces play a role in the microstructure evolution, although their relative importance is not well understood. Here, we compare data published in the literature regarding dislocation loop damage in pure W under ion irradiation to new results on nanocrystalline and coarse grained HEAs irradiated under single and dual ion beams. Dislocation loop damage evolution has been studied. The results suggest that both grain boundaries and grain matrices play important roles in the microstructure evolution of HEAs with grain matrices playing the dominant role. Irradiation response and dislocation loop damage in coarse-grained (a) and nanocrystallinegrained (b) W-based HEAs as compared to coarse-grained (c) and nanocrystalline-grained (d) pure W material.

<sub><sup>
In the quest of new materials that can withstand severe irradiation and mechanical extremes for advanced applications (e.g. fission & fusion reactors, space applications, etc.), design, prediction and control of advanced materials beyond current material designs become paramount. Here, through a combined experimental and simulation methodology, we design a nanocrystalline refractory high entropy alloy (RHEA) system. Compositions assessed under extreme environments and in situ electron-microscopy reveal both high thermal stability and radiation resistance. We observe grain refinement under heavy ion irradiation and resistance to dual-beam irradiation and helium implantation in the form of low defect generation and evolution, as well as no detectable grain growth. The experimental and modeling results-showing a good agreement-can be applied to design and rapidly assess other alloys subjected to extreme environmental conditions.

High-entropy materials represent the state-of-the-art on the alloy design strategy for future applications in extreme environments. Recent data indicates that high-entropy alloys (HEAs) exhibit outstanding radiation resistance in face of existing diluted alloy counterparts due to suppressed damage formation and evolution. An extension of the HEA concept is presented in this paper towards the synthesis and characterization of novel high-entropy ceramics as emergent materials for application in environments where energetic particle irradiation is a major concern. A novel carbide within the quinary refractory system CrNbTaTiW has been synthesized using magnetron-sputtering. The material exhibited nanocrystalline grains, single-phase crystal structure and C content around 50 at.%. Heavy-ion irradiation with in-situ Transmission Electron Microscopy was used to assess the irradiation response of the new high-entropy carbide (HEC) at 573 K and a comparison with the HEA within the system is made. No displacement damage effects appear within the microstructures of both HEA and HEC up to a dose of 10 displacements-per-atom. Surprisingly, the HEC has not amorphized under the investigated conditions. Xe was implanted in both materials and bubbles nucleated, but smaller sizes compared with conventional nuclear materials shedding light they are potential candidates for use in nuclear energy.

**A methodology to generate crystal-based molecular structures for atomistic simulations**

<sub><sup>
We propose a systematic method to construct crystal-based molecular structures often needed as input for computational chemistry studies. These structures include crystal ``slabs" with periodic boundary conditions (PBCs) and non-periodic solids such as Wulff structures. We also introduce a method to build crystal slabs with orthogonal PBC vectors. These methods are integrated into our code, Los Alamos Crystal Cut (LCC), which is open source and thus fully available to the community. Examples showing the use of these methods are given throughout the manuscript.

**Molecular-Dynamics Analysis of the Mechanical Behavior of Plasma-Facing Tungsten**

Asanka Weerasinghe, <b>Enrique Martínez</b>, Brian D. Wirth, Dimitrios Maroudas

January 2023

<sub><sup>
We report a systematic computational analysis of the mechanical behavior of plasma-facing component (PFC) tungsten focusing on the impact of void and helium (He) bubble defects on the mechanical response beyond the elastic regime. Specifically, we explore the effects of porosity and He atomic fraction on the mechanical properties and structural response of PFC tungsten, at varying temperature and bubble size. We find that the Young modulus of defective tungsten undergoes substantial softening that follows an exponential scaling relation as a function of matrix porosity and He atomic content. Beyond the elastic regime, our high strain rate simulations reveal that the presence of nanoscale spherical defects (empty voids and He bubbles) reduces the yield strength of tungsten in a monotonically decreasing fashion, obeying an exponential scaling relation as a function of tungsten matrix porosity and He concentration. Our detailed analysis of the structural response of PFC tungsten near the yield point reveals that yielding is initiated by emission of dislocation loops from bubble/matrix interfaces, mainly 1/2⟨111⟩ shear loops, followed by gliding and growth of these loops and reactions to form ⟨100⟩ dislocations. Furthermore, dislocation gliding on the ⟨111⟩{211} twin systems nucleates 1/6⟨111⟩ twin regions in the tungsten matrix. These dynamical processes reduce the stress in the matrix substantially. Subsequent dislocation interactions and depletion of the twin phases via nucleation and propagation of detwinning partials lead the tungsten matrix to a next deformation stage characterized by stress increase during applied straining. Our structural analysis reveals that the depletion of twin boundaries (areal defects) is strongly impacted by the density of He bubbles at higher porosities. After the initial stress relief upon yielding, increase in the dislocation density in conjunction with decrease in the areal defect density facilitates the initiation of dislocation-driven deformation mechanisms in the PFC crystal.

Short-range order (SRO) in multicomponent concentrated alloys affects their mechanical response. Hence, is paramount to understand how composition modifies the chemical ordering in the system to design materials with optimal properties. We present here a methodology to predict the SRO and thermodynamic properties in chemically complex systems and apply it to the WTaCrVHf quinary alloy. We observe that the addition of Hf significantly modifies the SRO, mainly at intermediate to low temperatures, matching experimental observations.

**Volume of a dislocation network**

<sub><sup>
We derive a simple analytical line integral expression for the relaxation volume tensor of an arbitrary interconnected dislocation network. This quantity determines the magnitude of dislocation contribution to the dimensional changes and volumetric swelling of a material, and highlights the fundamental dual role of dislocations as sources of internal strain as well as carriers of plastic deformation. To illustrate applications of the method, we compute the relaxation volume of a stacking fault tetrahedron, a defect commonly occurring in fcc metals; the volume of an unusual tetrahedral configuration formed by the $(a/2)\ensuremath{\langle}111\ensuremath{\rangle}$ and $a\ensuremath{\langle}001\ensuremath{\rangle}$ dislocations in a bcc metal; and estimate the relative contribution of extended dislocations to the volume relaxation of heavily irradiated tungsten.

**Interstitial hydrogen enhances the mobility of some grain boundaries in tungsten**

Nithin Mathew, Danny Pérez, Wonjoon Suk, Blas P. Uberuaga, <b>Enrique Martínez</b>

May 2022

<sub><sup>
Abstract Segregation of interstitials at a grain boundary (GB) is known to generally lower its mobility. This phenomenon, called ‘solute-drag’, has important ramifications on the process of recrystallization and microstructural evolution. In this manuscript, we present predictions from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations which demonstrate that interstitial hydrogen in tungsten can in fact increase the mobility of some GBs which exhibit shear coupling. Assuming a disconnection-based mechanism, activation energies and pre-factors for disconnection nucleation are predicted from simulations of shear-coupled motion. In GBs where enhanced mobility is predicted, interstitial H reduces both the activation energy and the pre-factor for disconnection nucleation, thus effectively increasing the mobility. For GBs with diminished mobility, MD predicts that presence of interstitial H reduces the pre-factor and, in some cases, increases the activation energy. The reduction in the activation energy inferred from MD simulations are confirmed by nudged elastic band calculations. Temperature-dependent structural transitions are observed for some GBs, and the effect of interstitial H is found to change with the changes in structure. The effect of interstitial H is predicted to be complex and highly variable, providing some plausible explanations for experimental observations on the recrystallization of tungsten in presence of H-loaded plasma.

**Atomistic and machine learning studies of solute segregation in metastable grain boundaries**

April 2022

<sub><sup>
The interaction of alloying elements with grain boundaries (GBs) influences many phenomena, such as microstructural evolution and transport. While GB solute segregation has been the subject of active research in recent years, most studies focus on ground-state GB structures, i.e., lowest energy GBs. The impact of GB metastability on solute segregation remains poorly understood. Herein, we leverage atomistic simulations to generate metastable structures for a series of [001] and [110] symmetric tilt GBs in a model Al-Mg system and quantify Mg segregation to individual sites within these boundaries. Our results show large variations in the atomic Voronoi volume due to GB metastability, which are found to influence the segregation energy. The atomistic data are then used to train a Gaussian Process machine learning model, which provides a probabilistic description of the GB segregation energy in terms of the local atomic environment. In broad terms, our approach extends existing GB segregation models by accounting for variability due to GB metastability, where the segregation energy is treated as a distribution rather than a single-valued quantity.

**Influence of stress correlations on dislocation glide in random alloys**

Ali Rida, <b>Enrique Martínez</b>, David Rodney, Pierre-Antoine Geslin

March 2022

<sub><sup>
Solute strengthening is an important mechanism that contributes to improving the mechanical properties of alloys and particularly the recent generations of concentrated alloys. The stress field emerging from an elastic model of a random solid solution displays strongly anisotropic correlations that interact differently with dislocations of different characters. In the present paper, we investigate the depinning transition of edge and screw dislocations evolving in such a correlated stress environment using a dislocation dynamics numerical model. We find that edge dislocations are only weakly affected by the correlations, while screw dislocations are strongly influenced, showing a smaller critical stress, which increases with the amplitude of the stress noise with a larger exponent than the edge dislocation. The numerical results are compared with existing statistical models of solute strengthening, allowing to discuss critically their assumptions.
