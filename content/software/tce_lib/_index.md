description: "Tensor cluster expansion library"

Energetics drive atomistic simulations. However, full energetics calculations of concentrated alloys is notoriously expensive.

We developed a library available on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/p/tce-lib) that interfaces with Atomic Simulation 
Environment [(ASE)](https://pypi.org/p/ase) for fitting the energetics of alloys to a cluster expansion model, allowing for inexpensive simulations
of large systems. The implementation details will be on [arXiv](arxiv.org) shortly ðŸ˜Š
