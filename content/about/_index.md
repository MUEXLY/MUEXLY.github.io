          <p style="margin-bottom;3cm;">The main topic of research is to better understand the behavior of materials under extreme environments of temperature, deformation and irradiation to predict and design materials with optimal performance.</p>
          <b><p style="margin-bottom;3cm;">Why is this important?</p></b>
          <ul>
               <li>Materials fail to withstand the extreme environments posed by advanced applications, lowering their efficiency (power generation, aerospace, transportation, etc).</li>
               <li>Known materials do not provide the expected/desired properties (batteries, fuel cells, conducting materials, transportation).</li>
               <li>Control over material properties is insufficient (explosives, soft matter).</li>
               <li>Current theory and modeling does not fully predict materials behavior.</li>
          </ul>
