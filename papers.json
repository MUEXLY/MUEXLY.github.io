      "abstract": "High-entropy alloys have drawn recent interest for their promising mechanical properties and irradiation resistance. Various properties, namely transport properties, are controlled by point defect concentration, which must be known before performing atomistic simulations to compute transport coefficients. In this work, we present a general Langmuir-like model for impurity concentration in an arbitrarily complex solid solution and apply this model to generate expressions for concentrations of vacancies and small interstitial atoms. We then calculate the vacancy concentration as a function of temperature in the equiatomic CoNiCrFeMn and FeAl alloys with modified embedded-atom-method potentials for various chemical orderings, showing there is no clear correlation between vacancy thermodynamics and chemical ordering in the CoNiCrFeMn alloy but clear systematic patterns for FeAl.",

      "abstract": "The mobility of a 1/2< 111>{110} edge dipole in alpha-iron has been studied using molecular dynamics simulations. Collision cascades generated by keV recoils have been shown to induce the migration of dislocations. In order to elucidate the origin of the motion of these dislocations, and separate the production of defects from temperature or pressure effects, a stressed region of different shapes (sphere and cylinder) is simulated close to the edge dipole. We observe that the generated shock wave triggers the movement of the dislocations even when no defects are produced. The shape of the distorted region and the character of the dislocations influence the way the dislocations move, due to the change in Peach-Koehler force direction and to the fact that the shock waves arrive to the different parts of the dislocations at different times.",
